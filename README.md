# COVID-19-Analysis-Project
This was a guided project to analyze the countries with the highest number of COVID-19 positive cases against number of tests between January 20, 2020 and June 1, 2020.

An updated dataset can be obtained on Kaggle, COVID19 Worldwide Testing Data - Number of tests conducted from different countries over time https://www.kaggle.com/lin0li/covid19testing

Further insights can be obtained from the updated dataset since the dataset used for this analysis was from a guided study project.
